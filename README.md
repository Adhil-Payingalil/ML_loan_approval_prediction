# Loan Approval Prediction - A Comparative ML Study

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict loan approval status using the Kaggle "Loan Status Prediction" dataset. It demonstrates:

*   Comprehensive data preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling).
*   Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
*   Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
*   Comparative analysis of five classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree) on both full and RFE-selected feature sets.

## Key Techniques & Technologies

*   **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imblearn
*   **ML Techniques:** Data Cleaning, EDA, SMOTE, RFE, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC), Classification Algorithms.

## Key Finding Highlight

The study found that while using all features generally yielded slightly higher accuracy (SVM/Naive Bayes best at ~74%), RFE significantly improved Logistic Regression's performance (73% accuracy), demonstrating the nuanced impact of feature selection across different algorithms.
